# Introduction to Scouting

This is an introductory guide that aims to familiarize you with Scouting generally, and our Den and Webelos information specifically. Please do not hesitate to contact me at <hosier.david@gmail.com> with any questions that may arise while reading through this. This is a living document that will be updated as points of clarification are brought to my attention.

## Webelos Uniform

You can find a description of the Webelos uniform at: <http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/CubScouts/Uniform/webelos.aspx>. There is also a [Webelos Scout Uniform Inspection Sheet](/scouts/webelos/UniWebelos.pdf) that shows where to attach all the insignia that is available for the uniform. I think this may be confusing for new families since it shows more stuff than what we need. When you buy a shirt, you can buy it with most of the patches already sewn on. However, if you choose to buy the patches and attach them yourself, this document will help you identify how and where to attach those patches.

**Note:** Current Scouts who are becoming Webelos Scouts are permitted to continue wearing their blue Cub Scout uniforms. There is also a tan/olive uniform that Webelos Scouts can use. This tan/olive uniform is the same that is worn by Boy Scouts. It is up to each family to decide when and whether or not to switch to the tan/olive uniform. Some families have already expressed their intent to continue wearing the blue uniforms, at least initially. This is normal for Webelos Dens to have a mix of uniforms. Since you are new to Scouting, this choice obviously does not apply, and you will choose the tan uniforms.

Below is the list of items you will need. Each item has a link to the online Scouting store for your reference. However, the River City Scout Shop is down off Business 80. I highly suggest you go to the store and not try to order online. The people at the store will help make sure you get all the right patches you need for the shirt.

### Required Items

| Item | Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--: | :---- |
| Shirt | $29.99-$44.99 | There are four choices of shirt: [S/S Cotton](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/shirts/centennial-boy-scouttm-short-sleeve-cotton-rich-poplin-uniform-shirt.html), [S/S Microfiber](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/shirts/youth-polyester-microfiber-short-sleeve-shirt.html), [L/S Cotton](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/shirts/centennial-boy-scouttm-long-sleeve-cotton-rich-poplin-uniform-shirt.html), [L/S Microfiber](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/shirts/youth-polyester-microfiber-long-sleeve-shirt.html). |
| [Cap](http://www.scoutstuff.org/centennial-webelos-cap.html)  | $14.99 | |
| [Neckerchief](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/bandanas-neckerchiefs/webelos-youth-neckerchief.html) | $9.99 | |
| [Neckerchief Slide](http://www.scoutstuff.org/webelos-scout-neckerchief-slide.html) | $5.99 | |
| [Belt](http://www.scoutstuff.org/centennial-boy-scouttm-web-belt.html) | $12.99 | I think there is only one olive belt, but just double-check with the staff at the Scout Shop to make sure. |
| [Colors](http://www.scoutstuff.org/webelos-colors.html) | $5.99 | The boys will earn pins for each adventure we complete next year. The adventures are our requirements to earn the Webelos rank. These colors hang from the sleeve, and the pins will be affixed to the colored strips of fabric. |
| Patches | ? | The patches you will need are, the American flag (I believe this might already be affixed to all shirts sold at the Scout Shop), the Pack numerals 735, the Golden Empire Council patch (also already affixed I think), the World Crest, and the 'Den 8' patch[^1].
| Webelos Handbook | $12.99-$18.99 | Choose either the [Perfect-Bound](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/literature-media/handbooks/handbook-cs-we-perf-bnd.html) or [Coil-Bound](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/literature-media/handbooks/handbook-cs-we-coil.html) handbook. Having used the perfect-bound version the last couple years, I opted for the coil-bound book for next year. The durability of the perfect-bound just isn't where it should be, and this book needs to last for two years. |

[^1]: I'm told that Webelos Dens typically will come up with a name instead of using our Den number. What I was told is that Dens will typically look for cool-looking patches at the shop, and choose their Den name according to what patch they like. Then instead of wearing the Den number patch on the sleeve, they wear the Den emblem patch they've chosen. I don't see any reason why we would not do this. So you may want to hold off on buying the Den 8 on the presumption that we will choose an emblem to wear instead.


### Optional Items

As was mentioned at the Round-Up, our Pack considers full uniform to be from the waist up. However, it's perfectly appropriate to wear the true full uniform if you so desire. These are the additional items that can be purchase to complete the uniform.

| Item | Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--: | :---- |
| [Olive Canvas Convertible Pants](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/pants/youth-centennial-canvas-convertible-pants.html) | $34.99 | |
| [Olive Microfiber Switchbacks](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/pants/youth-polyester-microfiber-switchbackstm.html) | $44.99 | |
| [Olive Cargo Shorts](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/youth/shorts/boy-scouttm-uniform-canvas-cargo-shorts-youth.html) | $27.99 | |
| Socks | $7.99-$9.99 | The information I found online seems to be a bit outdated, since it refers to socks with red tops. The socks they sell at the online Scout shop do not appear to have a red top. Just double-check with the Scout Shop employees that you are getting the right thing if you want to buy socks. They come in three styles: [Knee](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/socks/boy-scout/boy-scouttm-official-uniform-knee-socks.html), [Crew](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/socks/boy-scout/centennial-bsar-uniform-coolmax-crew-socks.html), and [Low-Cut](http://www.scoutstuff.org/bsa/uniforms-insignia/socks/boy-scout/centennial-bsar-uniform-coolmax-low-cut.html) |
