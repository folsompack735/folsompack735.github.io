title: Webelos Den Naming
---

I've been told that it is customary for Webelos Dens to choose a name and emblem. We will cease to be referred to by our Den number and instead referred to by the name of our choosing. Along with a name, the Den can choose an emblem. This is a small patch that can be worn on the tan uniforms only.

More information on naming and patches can be found [HERE](http://www.boyscouttrail.com/patrol-patch.asp) and [HERE](http://www.boyscouttrail.com/custom-patrol-patch.asp).

I would like each boy to choose a patch that they like from these sources, making sure to choose one that appears to be readily available in quantities of 10-15. Then we will have several votes to whittle down the choices and ultimately choose our new emblem. Once an emblem has been chosen, the boys will decide on a new name together.

As stated above, the emblems can only be worn on the tan uniforms. Boys opting to stay with the blue uniform should continue to wear the Den number patch on the sleeve.
